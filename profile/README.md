UnSpenda: The Future of Reward Points Management
Inspiration
UnSpenda was born from the idea that managing reward points should be as easy as having a conversation. It's designed for those who seek seamless integration of financial management into their daily routine.

What it does
UnSpenda revolutionizes the way you interact with your reward points by integrating with Alexa. This voice-activated app takes the hassle out of navigating websites and makes it incredibly simple for everyone, including visually impaired users, to access their bank accounts and utilize their points effectively.

How we built it
Our journey in building UnSpenda involved rigorous coding marathons, creative design thinking, and implementing intuitive voice recognition technology. We leveraged the flexibility of Alexa's skills to craft a user-friendly interface that feels like chatting with a friend.

Challenges we ran into
Creating an app that understands human speech as effortlessly as it understands spending habits was no small feat. We tackled challenges in natural language processing and user experience design to ensure that UnSpenda is not just functional but delightful to use.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're incredibly proud of bringing financial empowerment to our users' fingertipsâ€”or rather, their voice. UnSpenda is more than an app; it's a testament to how technology can make life easier and more accessible for everyone.

What we learned
The development of UnSpenda taught us that the future of technology lies in personalization and accessibility. We've learned to build with empathy, keeping the user's needs at the heart of every line of code.

What's next for UnSpenda
We envision UnSpenda becoming an indispensable part of daily life, expanding its capabilities to encompass all aspects of financial management. The road ahead includes smart budgeting features, investment tracking, and even more advanced voice-command services. Stay tuned, the best is yet to come!

UnSpenda is not just an app; it's your financial companion, redefining the way you think about and spend your reward points. Welcome to the future of financial accessibility.
